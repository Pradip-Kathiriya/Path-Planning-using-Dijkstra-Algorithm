## Project Description

In this project, I have implemented Dijkstra Algorithm for path planning in 2D obstacle space. The obstacles are static and defined using half plane method. The map of the obstacle is given in the problem statement. The output of this project is the simulation showing path finding process and plotting optimal path.
